A modern WordPress theme for LiveCanvas with multi-engine template support (Twig, Blade, and Latte).

== Description ==

Picowind is a modern theme architecture for WordPress that combines LiveCanvas workflows with flexible server-side templating.

It includes first-class support for:

* Twig (via Timber)
* Blade
* Latte

You can render templates with one engine, mix engines in the same page, and keep a single consistent context API.

=== Core Features ===

* Multi-engine rendering: Twig, Blade, and Latte
* Cross-engine composition (Twig can render Blade/Latte, and vice versa)
* Smart fallback rendering for templates
* Default fallback engine order: Twig, then Blade, then Latte
* Child theme-friendly template resolution
* Tailwind-based starter structure
* Omni Icon helper integration through `Picowind\omni_icon()`
* Service and hook auto-discovery using PHP attributes

=== Render API ===

Use these helper functions in PHP:

* `Picowind\render($paths, $context, $engine, $print, $silent)`
* `Picowind\render_string($string, $context, $engine, $print)`
* `Picowind\template_fallbacks($templates)`

When no explicit engine is passed, Picowind detects by extension:

* `.twig` => Twig
* `.blade.php` or `.php` => Blade
* `.latte` => Latte

For extension fallback candidates generated by `Picowind\template_fallbacks()`, the default order is:

1. `.twig`
2. `.blade.php`
3. `.latte`

=== Example: Mixed fallback ===

`Picowind\render([ 'components/hero.twig', 'components/hero.blade.php', 'components/hero.latte' ], $context);`

== Installation ==

1. Download the Picowind theme package.
2. In WordPress admin, go to Appearance > Themes > Add New.
3. Upload the theme zip and click Install Now.
4. Click Activate.

You can also install manually by extracting the theme folder to `wp-content/themes/picowind` and activating it from Appearance > Themes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which template engines are supported? =

Picowind supports Twig, Blade, and Latte.

= What is the default fallback order? =

When using generated fallback candidates (for example via `Picowind\template_fallbacks()`), Picowind tries:

1. Twig (`.twig`)
2. Blade (`.blade.php`)
3. Latte (`.latte`)

= Can I mix template engines in one project? =

Yes. Picowind provides cross-engine rendering helpers so Twig, Blade, and Latte templates can include or render one another.

= Does Blade and Latte get Timber-like helper functions? =

Yes. Picowind exposes Timber-compatible helper callables for Blade and Latte so common helper patterns can be used across engines.

= How do I render icons? =

Use:

`Picowind\omni_icon('mdi:home', ['class' => 'icon'])`

This helper integrates with the Omni Icon plugin when installed.

= Is a child theme supported? =

Yes. Picowind resolves templates from child and parent locations with a fallback strategy.
