**The fastest Bootstrap 5 WordPress starter theme. Experience the power of SASS merged with the WordPress Customizer.**

picowind 5 leverages the flexibility of Bootstrap 5 (currently v5.3+) and integrates it deeply with the WordPress Customizer. Customize Bootstrap's look and feel directly from your WordPress backend, and picowind will recompile the necessary CSS on the fly using a built-in SASS compiler that runs right in your browser.

## Key Features

*   **Bootstrap 5.3+ Integration:** Built on the latest stable version of the world's most popular front-end framework.

*   **Live SASS Compilation:** Modify Bootstrap SCSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing, components, etc.) directly through the WordPress Customizer. picowind uses **PicoSASS** (an implementation of Dart SASS running in the browser via JSPM) to recompile your CSS instantly upon hitting "Publish" or via a manual trigger in the admin bar.

    *   Control Bootstrap SCSS variables.

## Getting Started

1.  **Installation:** Install like any other WordPress theme. Download the `.zip` file, **RENAME** it to "**picowind.zip**" and upload it via the WordPress admin panel (`Appearance > Themes > Add New`) or upload the extracted folder via FTP to `/wp-content/themes/`.
2.  **Child Theme (Recommended):** For customization beyond the Customizer, it's highly recommended to use a child theme. You can download a starter child theme from the [picowind website](https://picowind.com/#downloads).
3.  **Customize:** Navigate to `Appearance > Customize` in your WordPress admin panel. Explore the various sections (Colors, Typography, Global Options, Buttons, Forms, Navbars, etc.) to tailor the theme to your needs.
4.  **Compile SASS:**
    *   **Via Customizer:** Make your changes and click "Publish". The SCSS will automatically recompile in your browser, and the new CSS bundle will be saved via AJAX.
    *   **Via Admin Bar:** While viewing the frontend (as an administrator), click the "SASS" icon in the admin bar and choose "Recompile Once" or "Recompile Continuously".

## How SASS Compilation Works

1.  **Customizer Changes:** When you modify SCSS variables in the Customizer, the values are saved as theme mods.
2.  **PicoSASS Trigger:** When you publish changes or use the admin bar trigger, the `picosass.js` script is loaded.
3.  **SCSS Generation:** JavaScript reads the SCSS theme mods, constructs the SASS code (variables + `@import 'main';`), and passes it to the Dart SASS compiler running in the browser.
4.  **Compilation:** PicoSASS fetches necessary Bootstrap SCSS files (from the theme folder, potentially falling back to the parent theme if using a child theme) and compiles the final CSS.
5.  **Live Preview:** The compiled CSS is injected into the Customizer preview iframe (or the main page if using the admin bar trigger) via a `<style id="picosass-injected-style">` tag.
6.  **Saving:** After compilation (and Customizer save, or manual trigger completion), the compiled CSS is sent via AJAX to a WordPress action (`picowind_save_css_bundle`) which saves it to `/wp-content/themes/(your-theme)/css-output/bundle.css`. The theme mod `css_bundle_version_number` is incremented to ensure cache busting.

*Note: SASS compilation requires administrator privileges and happens in the administrator's browser.*

## Customization

*   **WordPress Customizer:** The primary way to customize colors, typography, and theme options.
*   **Child Theme SCSS:** For more advanced CSS or structural changes, create a child theme and edit the `sass/_custom.scss` file. Remember to recompile using the admin bar link after saving your changes.
